# Food Ordering Chatbot using NLP, Logistic Regression, and TF-IDF Vectorizer

This repository contains the implementation of a simple food ordering chatbot built using Python, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, scikit-learn, and regular expressions. The chatbot is capable of understanding user inputs, asking for order details, and confirming the order.

## Features:
1. Uses NLP to interpret user input and generate responses.

2. Responds to greetings, orders, and expressions of gratitude.

3. Collects user information such as name, phone number, and address.

4. Utilizes Logistic Regression to classify user inputs based on predefined intents.

5. Employs the TF-IDF Vectorizer to transform user inputs into numerical representations for classification.

6. Regular expressions are used to extract specific details like names, phone numbers, addresses, and order quantities.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kapishs/Food-Ordering-Chatbot-using-NLP-Logistic-Regression.git
```
2. Install the necessary libraries by running:
```
pip install scikit-learn
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install regex
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to load the chatbot.

4. In the chat interface, provide the requested details step-by-step to place your order.


### Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. NLP (TF-IDF Vectorizer)
3. scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
4. re module (Regular Expressions)


### Future Enhancements:
1. Implementing a graphical interface for better user interaction.
2. Adding more complex conversation handling and order tracking.
